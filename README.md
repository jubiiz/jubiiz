📚 I'm a third year student completing a Bachelor's in Software Engineering (Co-op) at McGill University.

👶 I've been programming as a hobby since I'm 15, so even though I now write code for assignments and paychecks, I still debug memory leaks on my weekends for the fun of it 🤪.

🤖 I'm pursuing a curriculum in the ML/AI industry. I'm very much debating whether to do a masters in an AI related topic (I know, that doesn't narrow the topic down). I'd love to hear your opinion of what I should do about that.

🚀 I love to learn about low-level and embedded tech! I spent 2 years on the [McGill Rocket Team](https://github.com/McGillRocketTeam) developing code for their fligt computer, including one year as a software lead! There's no better feeling than writing better high-level (AI, ML, data) code by being comfortable with what happens under the hood. 🏎️
